# Count1ToBillion
test performance with languages

Hi,

I watched a video about counting 1 to 1000000000 with different program languages.

My test results are as below.

| test       | language   | version | result(s) |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------- | --------- |
| javaDemo1  | java       | 21.0.2  | 0.2151    |
| goDemo     | go         | 1.19.1  | 0.2152    |
| javaDemo2  | java       | 21.0.2  | 0.2196    |
| nodejsDemo | javascript | 18.12.0 | 0.653     |
| csharpDemo | .net       | 8.0     | 1.4821    |
| pythonDemo | python     | 3.10.11 | 56.5397   |

Maybe, there is something wrong with the code.

Welcome to submit new test code and results, as well as issues.
